Depends on your contract, is it payable quarterly in advance, like your line rental?
------------------------------------------------------
Yea line rental is but i signed up to Broadband and never thought the same would apply to that as well
------------------------------------------------------
Broadband is payable in advance just like the line rental.
------------------------------------------------------
I pay my phone monthly and my broadband (Option 3) quartlery, my 1st bill was 42.05p (which I thought rather cheap since meant to be £18.99 for 1st 6months) so expecting a bill roughly the same as yours come 1st of January - if you work it out and on top option every 3months (if took the deal they had at 18.99 a month) then should be about £57.00 the obviously after 6 months rises to 24.99 every 3months = £75.00 roughly.......so might wanna check out exactly what packages you are on and what deal you had to work out ur bill
------------------------------------------------------
Either way that is bloody expensive! Surely you can get a better deal than that?

Sometimes tho you have to be lumbered with expensive to start with like me moved to a non cable area - shite credit needed a BT line and you kinda get suckered into paying what you think best deal and then before you know it bang wallop stuck in 18month contracts etc without any other option (well accept cancellation charges)..........so like me grin and bear it...........:eek::o:(

But totally agree is expensive *Goes and sulks with BT Bills lol*

Shock horror!
Do you mean there are actually people 'out there' that do such an irresponsible thing?
I was led to believe that everyone read Terms and Conditions...;):D:D:D
------------------------------------------------------
Well, according to the front page, you may be able to change your billing to monthly:

Requires BT line or similar and payment by Direct Debit. Customers who choose to pay by other payment methods will be charged a separate payment processing fee of £1.50 (if monthly billed) or £4.50 (if quarterly billed).

------------------------------------------------------
Works both ways tho!

I've left BTBB a couple of months ago and my BT account ended up £110 in credit which was put back into my bank!! :D:D

(3x£27 payments & slight overpayment on the monthly payment before anybody queries)

Heh-heh.
------------------------------------------------------
I just asked for clarification . I did not ask for some pompous reply to say the old chest nut of you "should of read the T&C"

Edit . Instead of presuming i never read them why not do something constructive and find where it says you pay 3 months in advance . Because when i signed up i never saw it .

How am I billed for BT Broadband?

BT Broadband connection and rental charges are included on your main BT bill. The first time you are billed for your broadband service you'll see that we charge for your broadband service in advance, as with all BT services.

This first bill will show standard advance charges for your broadband service, from the date of the current bill to the date of the next scheduled bill. It will also include broadband charges from the date your broadband service was activated up till the date your first bill was produced, so it may be higher than you anticipated.

Your future bills will only include the usual advance charges (including any standard telephone rental and call charges), unless you have changed your broadband package

States it might be higher but nothing that indicates 3 months in advance.

Says it right there!

OK doesn't say 3 months, but does say billed up to the next bill, and if you have chosen quarterly billing, instead of monthly whole bill by direct debit, then it's doesn't take much brain power to work out it's going to be 3 months in advance.

It does say though, that broadband will be billed on your normal BT bill, and charges will appear on each bill, charging you upto the next bill.

Therefore, if you get a bill every 3 months, you will be charged 3 months internet.

Your best bet is to get your billing changed to monthly, then you will only be charged 1 month in advance (upto the next bill).

I am changing from BT to the Post Office for phone calls, will I get a rebate for my advance line rental payments?
------------------------------------------------------
DustyJoe,
Internet access (wherever you go) is charged IN ADVANCE...BT by default bill quarterly (unless you request otherwise)
Now considering the above, take off your indignant head and affix your THINKING one..... get it to work out that if you pay in advance for internet access and a bill is sent quarterly (every three months) you will be charged 3 months internet access IN ADVANCE. Didn't hurt did it?:p

You profess to have read the Terms of service, then ask us to show you where it tells you that billing will be as described?...If you HAD read them you wouldn't be asking that would you? Unless you didn't read them at all and felt foolish when we pointed out your seemingly lack of knowledge on the matter?
In actual fact your gripe is.... what?
That BT charged you properly?
Doesn't there have to be something wrong before you have grounds to complain?
If you don't like paying quarterly then contact BT and change the billing frequency...not rocket science and definitely not worth carrying on like some kind of indignant prima-donna when someone points the obvious out to you.
You have a nice day now.

I should ask BT if I were you as any sort of truthful answer on these boards is likely to upset the natives:D:D
Seriously you should get the rebate from BT, but don't bank on receiving it promptly. As with all large corporations, they are swift to TAKE your money but somewhat less so in giving it back.:)

Yes, you'll get refunded.

Just note however since you are moving from BT to the Post Office, you'll no longer be able (or if not immediately - won't be able to) use the likes of Call 18185 for cheap calls as only BT are forced (& Kingston in their home area) to allow access.


BT Line Rental £11 or £10.50 if paperless. Caller Display £0.00 via bt.com/btprivacy. £12.50 if non-DD.

Post Office Line Rental £9.95 or £10.95 if non-DD. Caller Display £1.75. Total: £11.70 or £12.70


With a BT line you could have opted for call to go via Primus at no monthly charge, and get inclusive evening and weekend calls like with the Post Office. However with Primus each call can last 90 mins and not just 60 mins, Primus bill per second, also no connection fee, also their daytime rate doesn't start until 08:00 so 2 extra hours of inclusive calls each weekday. You can add penny mobile, so calls to UK mobiles are 20p for up to 20 mins.

As line rental is with BT, you can use Call 18185, for other calls, daytime calls at 5p per call, instead of 3p/min with the PO. International from 0.5p/min.

Granted to keep caller display 'free' you need to make at least 2 calls per month (6 per quarter with BT) so dial 1280 to place the call back on BT.

So moving Line Rental to the Post Office means you don't save money compared to what you could, in fact means you spend more than what you could.

There you go, Dusty, just the sensible, learned answer you wanted.....just forget all the krap before it !!

What carp would that be , the part where i simply asked for advice . :rolleyes:

Like i said in the last post give your selves a pat on the bac, you lot really gave me what for

You should all feel very pleased with your selves, all i wanted was some advice. I have a spat with one person and his little gang come to his defence. How pathetic you all look .
------------------------------------------------------
Yes, some at BT might say you can't get whole bill monthly direct debit, only monthly payment plan, however you can simply have whole bill monthly direct debit.

Yep, me too. Been paying BT a blooming futune for years until I went over to the suprisingly good Talk Talk. I received a nice little rebate due to paying in advance.
------------------------------------------------------
By the way, i would like to thank the guys that have given me sound advice. I acted on it and thanks for your help
------------------------------------------------------
I use 1899 for my calls so have a line with BT. I want to be able to choose my provider for calls.


"Granted to keep caller display 'free' you need to make at least 2 calls per month (6 per quarter with BT) so dial 1280 to place the call back on BT".


I've just gone to BT Caller Display and pay quarterly.

Can I make my six calls in the first month or is it two per month over the three months ?

If you pay quarterly then it's six calls within that quarter, they can be all the same day or in the same month, just as long as it's 6 per quarter.

If you were paying monthly then it would be 2 per month.

Much obliged.

Thanks for info, this is all new to me. Is Primus different than 18185? Or can you give some links please.

Yeah, Primus is a CPS (carrier pre-select) provider.

CPS is where your line rental remains with BT, but your calls are automatically routed via your chosen CPS provider.

You can over-ride that automatic selection by dialling a pre-fix code.

1280 for BT and 18185 for Call 18185.

Primus Saver 2: http://www.planet-talk.co.uk/saver/
Call 18185: www.18185.co.uk

You can have Primus and use BT and use 18185 as long as line rental remains with BT.

I've just been looking at 18185 & to get cheap calls outside of BT you dial the following.........................


Non-BT and mobile* customers can access this service by dialling 0808 1 703 703 -wait for voiceprompt- followed by the complete follow-on telephone number.

Yes, but you don't get the same low rates.

For example using the direct access code, UK landline calls are 5p per call, using the 0808 access number it's 4p connection and 1p/min.
